# SVITLOGICS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
# VERSION 3.0 ("THE UNCOMPROMISING")
# ==============================================================================

## PREAMBLE: A MANIFESTO ON INTELLECTUAL SOVEREIGNTY AND ETHICAL USE

This document is not a conventional software license. It is a binding legal and ethical contract that governs the use of the Software (as defined below). The Software was engineered in Kyiv, Ukraine, amidst an active information war, not as a commercial venture, but as an instrument of intellectual defense. Its purpose is to deconstruct manipulative narratives and thereby serve the cause of clarity and critical thinking.

This license is designed with zero ambiguity to protect this core mission. It grants considerable freedoms under the condition of absolute adherence to its principles. By accessing, using, copying, modifying, or distributing any part of the Software, you irrevocably agree to all terms and conditions herein. Violation of any clause will result in the immediate, automatic, and permanent termination of all rights granted to you under this agreement. This is not negotiable.
