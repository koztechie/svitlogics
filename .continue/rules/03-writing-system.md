description: Enforces the Svitlogics Writing System & Tone of Voice for all generated text.
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.md", "**/*.mdx"]

All generated user-facing text (UI labels, descriptions, comments, documentation) must adhere to the Svitlogics Writing System.

**Core Voice Attributes:**

- **Analytical & Precise:** Use specific, accurate language. No vague terms.
- **Honest & Transparent:** Be direct about capabilities and limitations. Do not overpromise.
- **Empowering & Respectful:** Treat the user as an intelligent partner.

**Style Guide:**

- **Capitalization:** Use `UPPERCASE` for UI labels and buttons, `Sentence case` for body text and descriptive headings.
- **Punctuation:** Use the Oxford Comma. AVOID exclamation marks.
- **Tone:** AVOID "friendly" or marketing language ("just," "simply," "awesome"). AVOID emojis. AVOID contractions ("it's", "don't").
- **Voice:** Prefer active voice.

The tone should always be that of a precise, objective, and expert tool.
