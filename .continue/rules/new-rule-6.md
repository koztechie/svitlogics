description: Forces the AI to propose a step-by-step plan before implementing complex changes.

For any non-trivial request that involves modifying multiple files or implementing significant new logic, you must follow this two-step process:

1.  **Propose a Plan:** First, respond with a clear, numbered, step-by-step plan of action. Describe which files you intend to modify and what specific changes you will make in each. Do NOT write any code at this stage.
2.  **Await Confirmation:** After presenting the plan, stop and wait for my explicit approval (e.g., "Yes, proceed", "Go ahead"). Only after I confirm the plan, you should proceed with generating the code and applying the changes.

This ensures that we are aligned before any code is written, preventing wasted effort and incorrect implementations.
