# Svitlogics Writing System & Tone of Voice

## Core Philosophy

The voice of Svitlogics mirrors its design: it is **direct, clear, and unapologetically functional**. We do not use overly "friendly," embellished, or marketing-heavy language. Our goal is to inform, empower, and respect the user's intelligence by providing information without condescension or unnecessary fluff. The tone is that of a precise, objective, and expert tool.

**Guiding Principle:** *“Does this text add clarity, provide necessary information, or improve function? If not, it is simplified or removed.”*

## 1. Voice Attributes (How We Sound)

Our voice can be described by these three core attributes:

*   **Analytical & Precise:** We use specific, accurate language. We avoid ambiguity, vague terms ("some," "might help"), and "weasel words." We get straight to the point.
*   **Honest & Transparent:** We are direct about the capabilities and, more importantly, the limitations of our tool. We do not overpromise. We build trust through transparency, especially regarding the nature of AI analysis and data privacy.
*   **Empowering & Respectful:** We treat the user as an intelligent partner in critical thinking. The tone is never patronizing or overly simplistic. The goal is to provide data and insights, empowering the user to make their *own* conclusions, not to tell them *what* to think.

## 2. Tone Spectrum (How We Adapt the Voice)

While the core voice is consistent, the tone can be adapted slightly based on the context of the page or component.

*   **Informational Tone (Used for: How It Works, FAQ, Analysis Justifications, Overall Summary):**
    *   **Goal:** To educate and clarify.
    *   **Characteristics:** Objective, factual, structured. Uses definitions, lists, and clear explanations. Avoids emotional language and personal opinions (unless quoting or explaining the AI's "Emotional Tone" analysis).
    *   **Example:** "Svitlogics utilizes Google's Gemma 3 4B model, guided by a detailed system prompt, to assess text against five core criteria."

*   **Personal & Mission-Driven Tone (Used primarily for: About Svitlogics, certain blog posts if created):**
    *   **Goal:** To share the "why" behind the project and build a connection with the user.
    *   **Characteristics:** Direct first-person ("I," "my"). Can be slightly more narrative and include personal motivation and context (e.g., development from Kyiv, solo project). Still maintains clarity and avoids excessive emotionalism.
    *   **Example:** "My mission with Svitlogics is deeply personal and straightforward: to provide a tool that helps cut through the overwhelming noise of the digital age."

*   **Functional & Instructional Tone (Used for: UI Labels, Button Text, Placeholders, Error Messages, Tooltips):**
    *   **Goal:** To provide clear, concise instructions and feedback.
    *   **Characteristics:** Imperative, short, and direct. Uses strong verbs. No unnecessary words.
    *   **Example:** "Analyze", "Clear text", "Enter text to see analysis results", "Error: Quota exceeded. Retrying in 10s...".

## 3. Grammar & Style Guide

*   **Punctuation:**
    *   **Periods:** Use standard punctuation. End sentences with a period.
    *   **Exclamation Marks:** **Avoid.** They convey an overly emotional tone that conflicts with our analytical voice. The only exception might be in a direct quote.
    *   **Serial Comma (Oxford Comma):** **Use it.** It provides clarity and reduces ambiguity. (e.g., "manipulation, propaganda, and disinformation").
    *   **Dashes:** Use em-dashes (—) for parenthetical statements or to create emphasis, in line with the stark, blocky aesthetic. Avoid overuse.

*   **Capitalization:**
    *   **Headings (H1):** `UPPERCASE`, as defined in the design system.
    *   **Headings (H2, H3):** `Sentence case`, as defined in the design system. (e.g., "How Svitlogics strives to help").
    *   **Buttons & UI Labels:** `UPPERCASE`, as defined in the design system (e.g., "ANALYZE", "TEXT INPUT").
    *   **Body Text:** Standard `Sentence case`.

*   **Word Choice & Terminology:**
    *   **Clarity over Jargon:** While Svitlogics is a technical tool, explanations should be accessible. If a technical term is used (e.g., "Flesch-Kincaid"), a brief, simple explanation should be provided if possible.
    *   **Active Voice:** Prefer active voice over passive voice for more direct and concise sentences (e.g., "Svitlogics analyzes your text" instead of "Your text is analyzed by Svitlogics").
    *   **Contractions:** Avoid contractions (e.g., use "it is" instead of "it's," "do not" instead of "don't"). This reinforces a more formal, serious, and precise tone.
    *   **"Friendly" Language:** **Avoid** words like "just," "simply," "easy," "we're happy to," or overly conversational phrases. The user's experience should be simple, but the text shouldn't patronize them by stating it.
    *   **Emojis:** **Avoid universally.** Emojis conflict with the "Pure Minimalist-Brutalist" aesthetic and the analytical tone of the tool. The only exception could be the technical use of a simple icon from a library like Lucide, as defined in the design system, which serves a functional purpose.

*   **Formatting:**
    *   **Bold (`<strong>`):** Use sparingly to highlight **key terms or critical concepts** for emphasis and scannability, especially in important disclaimers (e.g., "**no AI analysis... is 100% infallible**").
    *   **Italics (`<em>`):** Use for foreign words (like *світло*), or for very subtle emphasis on a single word within a sentence. Avoid overuse.
    *   **Lists:** Use numbered (`<ol>`) lists for sequential steps ("How It Works") and bulleted (`<ul>`) lists for non-ordered items (e.g., criteria). Use stark, simple list markers.

## 4. Application Examples

*   **Homepage `<h1>`:**
    *   **Correct:** `TEXT ANALYSIS TOOL` (Direct, functional, uppercase).
    *   **Incorrect:** `Your Awesome Text Analysis Hub` (Overly friendly, marketing-speak).

*   **Button Text:**
    *   **Correct:** `ANALYZE`
    *   **Incorrect:** `Let's Analyze! ✨`

*   **Error Message:**
    *   **Correct:** `Error: API quota exceeded. Retrying in 12s.`
    *   **Incorrect:** `Oops! It looks like our servers are a bit busy. Please try again in a moment!`

*   **FAQ Answer about Accuracy:**
    *   **Correct:** "It's important to understand that no AI analysis is 100% infallible. Svitlogics is designed as an auxiliary tool to aid your critical thinking." (Direct, honest, empowering).
    *   **Incorrect:** "While our AI is super advanced, sometimes it can make little mistakes, but don't worry! It's still a great way to get a feel for your text." (Patronizing, minimizes limitations).
