![An introduction to the mission and methodology of Svitlogics](/images/articles/welcome-to-svitlogics.png)

My name is Eugene Kozlovsky. Svitlogics is my response to a problem I observe daily.

For a long time, I noted the pervasive manipulation in news, social media, and professional discourse. This observation crystallized into action after seeing a viral post that used the tragedy of war to justify poor service. While many saw patriotism, I identified a case of calculated emotional exploitation.

It was no longer sufficient to observe manipulation. I felt compelled to build a tool that would help others identify it.

### Our mission

The mission of Svitlogics is direct: to provide an accessible, transparent instrument for identifying manipulative techniques. It was developed as a solo project from my home in Kyiv, Ukraine, born from the daily reality of information warfare.

This tool is not a "truth machine." It does not deliver a "true" or "false" verdict. Effective manipulation rarely relies on a single, verifiable lie. Instead, it uses a complex web of emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and carefully framed narratives.

### How it works

Svitlogics is designed as an auxiliary instrument for your own critical thinking. By leveraging a cascade of advanced AI models, it deconstructs text and provides a structured report across five core criteria:

- Manipulative Content
- Propagandistic Content
- Disinformation
- Unbiased Presentation
- Emotional Tone

My core principle is that understanding **how** a message is constructed to influence you is the first and most critical step toward resisting it.

This blog will serve as a platform to explore these topics further, share insights on new techniques of manipulation, and document the continued development of Svitlogics.
