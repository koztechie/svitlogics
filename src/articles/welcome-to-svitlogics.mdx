My name is Eugene Kozlovsky. Svitlogics is not just an application; it is my answer to a problem I live with every day.

For a long time, I felt a passive anger towards the manipulation I saw everywhere â€” in the news, on social media, in professional discourse. This feeling crystallized into action after I saw a viral post that used the tragedy of war to justify poor service. People saw patriotism; I saw a masterclass in emotional exploitation.

It was no longer enough to simply see the manipulation. I had to build a tool to help others see it too.

### The Mission: Clarity in Chaos

The mission of Svitlogics is direct: to provide an accessible, transparent instrument for identifying manipulative techniques. It was developed as a solo project from my home in Kyiv, Ukraine, born from the daily reality of information warfare.

This tool is not a "truth machine." It does not deliver a simple "true" or "false" verdict. Effective manipulation rarely relies on a single, verifiable lie. Instead, it uses a complex web of emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and carefully framed narratives.

### How It Works

Svitlogics is designed as an auxiliary instrument for your own critical thinking. By leveraging a cascade of advanced AI models, it deconstructs text and provides a structured report across five core criteria:

- Manipulative Content
- Propagandistic Content
- Disinformation
- Unbiased Presentation
- Emotional Tone

My core principle is that understanding _how_ a message is constructed to influence you is the first and most critical step toward resisting it.

This blog will serve as a platform to explore these topics further, share insights on new techniques of manipulation, and document the continued development of Svitlogics.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.
