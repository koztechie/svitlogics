    "content": "My name is Eugene Kozlovsky. Svitlogics is not just an application; it is my answer to a problem I live with every day.\n\nFor a long time, I felt a passive anger towards the manipulation I saw everywhere â€” in the news, on social media, in professional discourse. This feeling crystallized into action after I saw a viral post that used the tragedy of war to justify poor service. People saw patriotism; I saw a masterclass in emotional exploitation.\n\nIt was no longer enough to simply see the manipulation. I had to build a tool to help others see it too.\n\n## The Mission: Clarity in Chaos\n\nThe mission of Svitlogics is direct: to provide an accessible, transparent instrument for identifying manipulative techniques. It was developed as a solo project from my home in Kyiv, Ukraine, born from the daily reality of information warfare.\n\nThis tool is not a \"truth machine.\" It does not deliver a simple \"true\" or \"false\" verdict. Effective manipulation rarely relies on a single, verifiable lie. Instead, it uses a complex web of emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and carefully framed narratives.\n\n## How It Works\n\nSvitlogics is designed as an auxiliary instrument for your own critical thinking. By leveraging a cascade of advanced AI models, it deconstructs text and provides a structured report across five core criteria:\n\n- Manipulative Content\n- Propagandistic Content\n- Disinformation\n- Unbiased Presentation\n- Emotional Tone\n\nMy core principle is that understanding _how_ a message is constructed to influence you is the first and most critical step toward resisting it.\n\nThis blog will serve as a platform to explore these topics further, share insights on new techniques of manipulation, and document the continued development of Svitlogics.\n\nThank you for joining me on this journey."
