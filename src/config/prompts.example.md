### English Prompt (`gemma_system_prompt_en.txt`)

The English prompt is a detailed document that instructs the AI to act as a specialist text analysis system. It defines the persona, core directives, methodology, and provides a comprehensive rubric for five analysis criteria:
- Manipulative Content
- Propagandistic Content
- Disinformation
- Unbiased Presentation (Impartiality)
- Emotional Tone

It also specifies the exact JSON output schema the AI must adhere to.
