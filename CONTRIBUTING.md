# Svitlogics Contribution Protocol

**DOCUMENT ID:** CONTR-V4.0 ("THE ETHOS")  
**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL

---

## I. Scope and Philosophy

This document provides the governing protocol for all contributions to the Svitlogics source code repository. Svitlogics is a specialized instrument, engineered in Kyiv, Ukraine, with a singular mission: to serve as a bulwark against informational chaos by providing a tool for the forensic deconstruction of text.

Engagement with this project requires a full understanding of its core philosophy. This protocol is designed to filter for precise, mission-aligned contributions and to ensure the system's integrity as a tool for disciplined thought. Casual or aesthetic-driven contributions are outside the scope of this project.

## II. The Core Axioms (Non-Negotiable)

All contributions—bug reports, feature proposals, and code submissions—will be evaluated against three foundational axioms. Non-compliance with any axiom will result in the immediate rejection of the contribution without further review.

1.  **AXIOM OF MISSION ALIGNMENT**: The contribution must directly enhance the instrument's capacity for textual analysis. It must improve clarity, analytical precision, security, or performance. Features introducing aesthetic embellishment, unnecessary user engagement mechanics, or any form of gamification are considered mission-hostile.
2.  **AXIOM OF ARCHITECTURAL PURITY**: The system's stateless, serverless architecture is a core design principle. Any contribution proposing data persistence for user-submitted content, introducing stateful server-side logic, or otherwise compromising the privacy-first model will be rejected.
3.  **AXIOM OF SYSTEMIC COHERENCE**: The contribution must integrate flawlessly with **The Ethos-Driven Design System**. This protocol is not a set of guidelines; it is the architectural blueprint. It mandates the strict use of the `Inter` typeface for UI and `Lora` for content, the established clinical color palette, and the 8px spatial grid. There are no deviations.

## III. Interaction Protocols

### 3.1 Anomaly Reporting (Bug Reports)

System anomalies compromise the instrument's integrity and must be reported with clinical precision.

1.  **Pre-Action Search**: Execute a thorough search of the existing [Issues database](https://github.com/koztechie/svitlogics/issues) to verify the anomaly is not a known artifact. Redundant reports will be closed.
2.  **Reporting Format**: Submissions must adhere to the following structure:
    - **Classification**: `[BUG] <Precise description of failure>`
    - **Replication Vector**: A deterministic, numbered sequence of actions to reproduce the system failure. If the anomaly is not 100% reproducible with the provided vector, the report is invalid.
    - **State Deviation Analysis**: A clear comparison of the documented `Expected State` versus the observed `Failed State`.
    - **Diagnostic Telemetry**: Full, unedited console logs, relevant network request/response data, browser/version, and OS/version are mandatory.

Submissions failing to meet these criteria are considered system noise and will be closed.

### 3.2 Strategic Proposals (Feature Requests)

Modifications to the instrument's core capabilities require a formal proposal.

1.  **Initiation**: Proposals are initiated exclusively via a new Issue.
2.  **Proposal Format**: The proposal must be structured as follows:
    - **Classification**: `[PROPOSAL] <Name of proposed module or function>`
    - **Strategic Justification**: A concise definition of the capability gap the proposal addresses.
    - **Mission Alignment Rationale**: A logical proof demonstrating how the proposal directly aligns with the Core Axioms. This is the primary evaluation criterion.
    - **System Integration Plan**: A high-level description of how the new module integrates with the existing stateless, serverless architecture without compromising it.

Proposals that are tactical (minor UI tweaks) rather than strategic will be rejected.

### 3.3 Code Submission (Pull Requests)

Code is the final, executed form of an approved proposal. Unsolicited code submissions will be rejected without review.

1.  **Branching Discipline**: Originate all branches from `dev`. Naming convention: `type/scope/short-description` (e.g., `feat/api/rate-limiter-v2`).
2.  **Code Integrity**: All code must be formatted (`npm run format`) and pass all linting checks (`npm run lint`). The build must be clean.
3.  **Commit Hygiene**: Commits must be atomic and adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. A well-curated commit history is a non-negotiable requirement.
4.  **Submission Brief**: The Pull Request description must reference the originating proposal issue and provide a clear, technical changelog.
5.  **Review Process**: Your code will be subjected to a rigorous review. The burden of proof for the code's correctness, security, and performance rests solely with the contributor.

## IV. Technical Mandates

- **State**: Shall not be persisted on the server.
- **Security**: Client-side exposure of secrets is a critical failure. All sensitive operations must be proxied through the serverless backend.
- **Aesthetics**: Governed strictly by **The Ethos-Driven Design System**. No deviation.
- **Typography**: `Inter` for UI and headings; `Lora` for body copy. `Source Code Pro` for the input processor. No other fonts.
- **Geometry**: `border-radius` is forbidden. Sharp 90-degree corners are mandatory.
- **Language**: `TypeScript`. The use of `any` is forbidden except in cases of extreme, well-justified technical necessity.

## V. License

All contributions to this project are irrevocably licensed under the project's own license. By submitting a contribution, you agree to these terms.
